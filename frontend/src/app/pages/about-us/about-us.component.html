    About This Project
  </h1>
  <p>
    This project is aimed at building a lexical analyzer, consisting of two main components: a scanner and an SLR table analyzer. The scanner reads the text and transforms it into tokens, which are then evaluated by the SLR table.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Scanner
  </h2>
  <p>
    The scanner component is responsible for reading the input text and breaking it down into tokens. It is based on YAL (Yet Another Lexer) files, which define the lexical rules. Here's an example of a YAL file:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
(* Lexer for Grammar No. 1 - Simple arithmetic expressions for variables *)

(* Insert any headers here *)

let delim = [' ' '\t' '\n']
let ws = delim+
let letter = ['A'-'Z' 'a'-'z']
let digit = ['0'-'9']
let id = letter (letter | digit)*

rule tokens =
    ws        &#123; return WS &#125;
  | id        &#123; return ID &#125;               (* Replace with a valid action that returns the token *)
  | '+'       &#123; return PLUS &#125;
  | '*'       &#123; return TIMES &#125;
  | '('       &#123; return LPAREN &#125;
  | ')'       &#123; return RPAREN &#125;

(* Insert any trailers here *)
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    In this example, various patterns are defined for whitespace (<code>ws</code>), letters (<code>letter</code>), digits (<code>digit</code>), and identifiers (<code>id</code>). The <code>tokens</code> rule specifies how different patterns should be recognized and what tokens they should return.
  </p>
  <h2>
    SLR Table
  </h2>
  <p>
    The SLR (Simple LR) parser table is used to evaluate the tokens generated by the scanner. The parser configuration is based on an SLR grammar, which defines the parsing rules. Here is an example of an SLR parser configuration:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
/* Parser configuration for Grammar No.1 */
/* Follows the SLR grammar: */
/* E -&gt; E + T | T */
/* T -&gt; T * F | F */
/* F -&gt; ( E ) | id */

%token ID
%token PLUS
%token TIMES
%token LPAREN RPAREN
%token WS
IGNORE WS

expression:
    expression PLUS term
  | term
;
term:
    term TIMES factor
  | factor
;
factor:
    LPAREN expression RPAREN
  | ID
;
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This configuration defines tokens such as <code>ID</code>, <code>PLUS</code>, <code>TIMES</code>, <code>LPAREN</code>, and <code>RPAREN</code>. It also specifies rules for expressions, terms, and factors, describing how they can be composed.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What is a Scanner?
  </h2>
  <p>
    A scanner, also known as a lexical analyzer, is a program that reads the source code and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of meaning in the source code, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation. The scanner uses lexical rules, often defined in a lexer file, to identify and categorize these tokens.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What are SLR Tables?
  </h2>
  <p>
    SLR (Simple LR) tables are used in parser generators for syntax analysis. An SLR parser uses a parsing table to determine the actions to take (shift, reduce, accept, or error) based on the current state and the lookahead token. The parsing table is constructed from the grammar rules and is used to efficiently parse the input tokens and build the syntax tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    The combination of the scanner and the SLR parser allows the system to read input text, tokenize it, and then parse the tokens according to the specified grammar rules, enabling the analysis and processing of programming languages and other structured text.
